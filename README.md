# Piano To Go

This application contains 3 main features: a virtual piano that users can play either with their hands (in the air) or with a mouse, a page to practice intervals, and a melody playback page. Users can also record and play back their recordings, which are saved even after they exit the application. 

### How to run the project:

The user should run "freePlay.py" which uses graphics.py, intervals.py, and melodyPlayback.py. 
The user should also install the Leap Motion SDK and place all their files in this folder. Go to the following site to do so: [https://www.leapmotion.com/setup/desktop/]
Also, download PyAudio in order to be able to play wav files. 
Python2 should be used to run all programs since Leap is only compatible with Python2.

### Shortcut Commands:
No shortcut commands. You can click on the appropriate buttons on the screen to navigate the game. The back arrow will always take you back to the home screen.
